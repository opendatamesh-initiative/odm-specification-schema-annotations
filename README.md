The **Schema Annotation Specification (SAS)** is a sub-specification of [DPDS](https://github.com/opendatamesh-initiative/odm-specification-dpdescriptor) that specifies a set of standard annotations to describe entities and properties within a data schema. The annotations are independent of the schema definition language used. They can therefore be applied alongside any schema definition language that supports annotations (e.g., JSON Schema, Avro Schema, Protobuf, XSD, etc.). SAS is released under [Apache 2.0 license](./LICENSE). Contributions from the data community are welcomed!

This GitHub project is the starting point for SAS. Here you will find the information you need about the SAS, simple examples of what it looks like, and some general information regarding the project.

## Status
The current version of the SAS is [SAS v1.0.0-DRAFT](./versions/1.0.0-DRAFT.md).
A reader-friendly version of the specification can be found on our [project site](https://dpds.opendatamesh.org/specifications/sas/1.0.0-DRAFT/).

### Previous versions
This repository also contains all [previous versions](./versions).

Each folder in this repository, such as examples and schemas, contains folders about the current and previous versions of the specification.
