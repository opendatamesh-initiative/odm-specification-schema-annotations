# Specifications

## Main specification
The Data Product Specification (DPDS) is the main specification defined by the Open Data Mesh Initiative to describe all the components of a data product. 

DPDS defines what are the important components to describe and how they are organized within the descriptor document. 

Whenever possible the description of a component or one of its sub-parts is delegated to an independent specification defined within the Open Data Mesh Initiative (i.e. sub-specification) or by third parties (i.e. external specification).

## Sub-specifications

### Schema Annotation Specification
The Schema Annotation Specification (SAS) defines a set of standard annotations to describe entities and properties within a data schema.

???+ tip
    DPDS RECOMMEND to use this specification to provide metadata related to data exposed by output of ports.
